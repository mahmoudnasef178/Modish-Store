## 📱 Overview

**Modish Store** is a complete e-commerce mobile application developed as a graduation project by a team of developers. The app lets users browse a product catalog, search and filter items, manage a cart, complete checkout, and receive automatic order confirmation emails — all backed by a clean, scalable Flutter architecture.

> **My role:** I was responsible for the end-to-end design and development of the Flutter application — architecture, UI/UX implementation, state management, and API integration — while collaborating with teammates on the overall product.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Framework** | Flutter (Dart) |
| **Architecture** | Clean Architecture, feature-first folder structure |
| **State Management** | `flutter_bloc` (Bloc / Cubit) |
| **Dependency Injection** | `get_it` (service locator) |
| **Networking** | `dio`, `http` |
| **Local Storage** | `shared_preferences`, `flutter_secure_storage` |
| **Email Service** | `emailjs` (order confirmation emails) |
| **Media** | `cached_network_image`, `image_picker`, `flutter_svg` |
| **Other** | `url_launcher`, `get_it`, `gap` |

## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** principles with a **feature-first** structure. Each feature (Cart, HomePage, Login/Signup, Profile, Search, Onboarding, Splash) is self-contained and split into three layers:

```
feature/
├── data/          # Models & repositories — talks to the API via Dio
├── logic/         # Bloc/Cubit — business logic & state management
└── presentation/  # Views & widgets — UI only, no business logic
```

Dependencies are wired up through a central **service locator** (`get_it`), which registers a singleton `Dio` client and lazily-instantiated repositories for each feature — keeping the UI layer decoupled from data sources and making the codebase easy to test and extend.
